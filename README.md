This repository contains the Python implementation of the sparsity-promoting extended Kalman filter (EKF) for target tracking in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This project is based on the theoretical framework provided by Engin Ma≈üazade et al., aimed at minimizing estimation error while promoting energy efficiency.
